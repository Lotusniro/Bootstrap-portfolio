# Bootstrap-portfolio

## Description

This is a portfolio website that I created using Bootstrap. It is a responsive website that will display properly on any screen size. It contains a navbar, Work section,About me Section and contact me section along with responsive images.
I used the Bootstrap grid system to create a responsive layout for the website on about me section.

I used the google fonts and bootstrap Icons to style the website.
these are the screenshots of the website:
